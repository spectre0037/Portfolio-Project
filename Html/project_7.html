                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Businesses still manually process digital invoices, which is
                    time-consuming and prone to errors. This project aims to
                    automate the extraction of key details from invoices using
                    advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques. By
                    leveraging YOLOv4 for object detection and Tesseract OCR for
                    text recognition, we can significantly reduce the time and
                    effort required for invoice processing.</p>

                <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Trained a YOLOv4 model for object detection on a custom
                        dataset of invoices, achieving high accuracy in
                        detecting key fields such as invoice number, date, and
                        total amount.</li>
                    <li>Implemented Tesseract OCR to accurately recognize and
                        extract text from the detected fields, ensuring reliable
                        data extraction.</li>
                    <li>Developed an end-to-end automated pipeline that handles
                        invoice upload, object detection, text recognition, and
                        data extraction seamlessly.</li>
                    <li>Integrated the pipeline with a user-friendly web
                        interface for easy access and operation.</li>
                </ul>
