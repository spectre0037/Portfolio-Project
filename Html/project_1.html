            <h1>AI-Driven Cybersecurity Investigation</h1>
            <p>AI-driven security automation enhances threat detection, reduces
                investigation time, and improves accuracy. By leveraging
                advanced machine learning algorithms and big data analytics, our
                AI system can identify and respond to threats in real-time,
                providing a robust defense against cyber attacks.</p>

            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>70% reduction in investigation time:</strong> Our AI
                    system automates the analysis of security logs and alerts,
                    significantly reducing the time required to investigate
                    potential threats.</li>
                <li><strong>95% accuracy in AI-based threat
                        classification:</strong> Utilizing state-of-the-art
                    machine learning models, our system achieves high accuracy
                    in identifying and classifying various types of cyber
                    threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated KQL query execution for security
                        monitoring:</strong> The system automatically executes
                    Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries to monitor and analyze
                    security data, ensuring continuous protection and quick
                    response to incidents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <p>This project involved the development and deployment of an
                AI-driven cybersecurity platform designed to enhance the
                efficiency and effectiveness of threat detection and response.
                Key components of the project include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Aggregating and
                    preprocessing large volumes of security data from various
                    sources, including network logs, endpoint data, and threat
                    intelligence feeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning Models:</strong> Developing and
                    training machine learning models to detect anomalies,
                    classify threats, and predict potential security
                    incidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Implementing automation
                    workflows to streamline the investigation and response
                    processes, reducing the manual effort required by security
                    analysts.</li>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Monitoring:</strong> Setting up real-time
                    monitoring and alerting mechanisms to ensure immediate
                    detection and response to security events.</li>
            </ul>
