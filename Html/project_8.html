            <h1>Intelligent Automation of Swift Messages</h1>
            <p>Extracting entities from Swift financial messages using NLP and
                Named Entity Recognition.</p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project aims to automate the manual data entry process by
                extracting key details from Swift messages. By leveraging
                Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Named Entity Recognition
                (NER), the system can identify and extract important entities,
                significantly reducing human workload and minimizing errors.</p>

            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated the extraction of entities such as Beneficiary
                    Name, Letter of Credit (LC) Number, and Transaction Amount
                    from Swift messages.</li>
                <li>Implemented Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for Named Entity
                    Recognition, achieving high accuracy in entity
                    extraction.</li>
                <li>Achieved an 8 Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) savings, allowing
                    the reallocation of human resources to more strategic
                    tasks.</li>
                <li>Enhanced data accuracy and consistency by reducing manual
                    entry errors.</li>
                <li>Improved processing speed, enabling real-time data
                    extraction and analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Technology Stack</h2>
            <p>The project utilizes a robust technology stack to achieve its
                goals:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> The primary programming language
                    used for developing the automation scripts and models.</li>
                <li><strong>FastX Embeddings:</strong> Used for generating word
                    embeddings to capture the semantic meaning of words in Swift
                    messages.</li>
                <li><strong>CRF Model:</strong> Conditional Random Fields model
                    employed for Named Entity Recognition to accurately identify
                    and extract entities.</li>
                <li><strong>NLP Techniques:</strong> Various Natural Language
                    Processing techniques applied to preprocess and analyze the
                    text data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
            <p>To further improve the system, the following enhancements are
                planned:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Integration with additional financial message formats to
                    expand the system's applicability.</li>
                <li>Incorporation of machine learning algorithms to continuously
                    improve entity extraction accuracy.</li>
                <li>Development of a user-friendly interface for easier
                    interaction and monitoring of the automation process.</li>
                <li>Implementation of advanced data validation techniques to
                    ensure the integrity and reliability of extracted data.</li>
            </ul>
