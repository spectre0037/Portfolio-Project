        <section id="overview">
            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The SWIFT network is a global provider of secure financial messaging services, handling thousands of financial messages daily. 
               This project focuses on automating the classification and extraction of key information from these messages using machine learning techniques. 
               By leveraging advanced algorithms, we aim to reduce manual intervention, minimize errors, and improve processing speed.</p>

            <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automated Classification:</strong> Successfully developed a system that classifies SWIFT messages into 12 distinct categories, reducing the need for manual sorting.</li>
                <li><strong>Entity Extraction:</strong> Implemented machine learning models to extract 23 key entities from messages, such as transaction amounts, dates, and beneficiary details.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficiency Gains:</strong> Achieved operational efficiency gains equivalent to 23 Full-Time Equivalents (FTEs), allowing better resource allocation.</li>
            </ul>
